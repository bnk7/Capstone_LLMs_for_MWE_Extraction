Definition: A multiword expression is a string of multiple words which act as a single semantic or syntactic element. A multiword expression can be a sequence of two or more nouns that form a single noun (noun-noun compound), a verb followed by a particle which function syntactically as a single verb (verb particle construction), an expression starting with a verb that has little semantic content and followed by another word or phrase that carries the entire expression’s meaning (light verb construction), or a phrase that could have a literal reading but is used in a context where its meaning is non-compositional (idiom). Proper nouns, borrowings, and hyphenated text are not multiword expressions.
Question: Given the paragraph below, identify a list of possible multiword expressions and for each entry explain why it either is or is not a multiword expression:
Example 1:
“ It 's just accepted -- and expected -- now .
 Q : How are you using technology in           been a big breakthrough because it allows the patient to get involved in their care ; they can really see what 's going on .
With a magnification of up to 40 times , the camera zooms in close on the teeth , then broadcasts the image on a large screen .
When we were kids and went to the dentist , we just believed whatever he said .
Now I can say , ' You have a problem , and here it is . '
A picture 's worth a thousand words , so I always take a before and after shot .
It 's not the kind of thing you 'd show at a cocktail party , but I want people to really know what 's going on in the back of their mouths .
That kind of ties into our philosophy on the first visit .
We 're getting as much information about the patient as possible and giving them back as much info as we can , too .
